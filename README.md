# Nasi-Lemak Project Repository
Data Communication Final Team Project

Project Purpose:
To support Korea University students in balancing academic demands with daily needs, this project offers a dynamic campus ordering system. Our service connects students with available peers who volunteer as “runners” to fulfill requests for essentials, such as utensils, coffee, and Unistore items from on-campus locations. When a student submits a request, it is broadcast as a notification, allowing any available student to volunteer as the runner. This approach provides convenient access to necessities while rewarding runners with monetary compensation, creating a supportive and efficient campus community.

Project Objectives:
To fulfill our purpose of supporting Korea University students with a responsive campus ordering system, this project will demonstrate client-server architecture using the TCP/IP protocol. In this setup, a designated laptop will function as the central server, managing and broadcasting requests. When a client (student) submits a request through the system, it will route through the server and be relayed as a notification to all connected client devices. This structure enables efficient, real-time communication and ensures that any available student can receive and respond to requests, creating a dynamic, interconnected service.

Initial Ideas:
Group discussion with friends, One friend (Sarah) pointed out to create a delivery reward system among students in the campus which can ease students to access university shops while not moving and at the meantime rewarding the runner(another student) with monetary compensation.
